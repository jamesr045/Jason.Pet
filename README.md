This is Jason! He's a little virtual pet frog I made for a 1 week long game jam at MMU (and it won "Best Use of Theme"!!). He hops around the screen, helping you control media on your PC, and also has opinions on different sites and apps.

(if you wanna try him out you can download the "Jason.pet Build" file and run the executable)


The theme for the jam was "A Virtual Being", alongside an optional modifier of "cozy", so I thought this little guy would make the perfect fit.
This was my first time using the Windows API in a Unity project and overall I think it turned out well. You can also open the project with Unity and edit him and give him new reactions to websites or apps.
